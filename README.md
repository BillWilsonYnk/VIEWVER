## üìö Introduction

This comprehensive collection of Google dorks is designed for ethical hackers, security researchers, and bug bounty hunters seeking to discover vulnerable targets and security programs that offer rewards. These specialized search queries leverage Google's advanced search operators to uncover sensitive information, potential vulnerabilities, and bug bounty programs that might not be easily discoverable through conventional means.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Provide a curated list of effective Google dorks for bug bounty hunting
- Help security researchers find new bug bounty programs
- Assist in discovering potentially vulnerable targets
- Enhance the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking
- Save time in the initial discovery process

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**ETHICAL USE ONLY**: The information provided in this repository is meant for educational purposes and ethical security research only. Always:

- Obtain proper authorization before testing any system
- Respect the scope defined by bug bounty programs
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Never exploit vulnerabilities without permission
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations

Unauthorized testing may constitute illegal activity and could result in legal consequences.

## üîß How To Use This Collection

### Prerequisites

Before using these dorks:
- Ensure you have a basic understanding of bug bounty programs and web security
- Familiarize yourself with Google's search operators and syntax
- Set up a secure environment (VPN, privacy-focused browser, etc.)
- Understand the legal implications of security testing

### Best Practices

1. **Replace Target Placeholders**: Replace `target.com` in the dorks with your specific target domain
2. **Document Your Findings**: Keep detailed notes of what you discover
3. **Stay Within Scope**: Always verify that your target is within the allowed scope of testing
4. **Use Rate Limiting**: Space out your searches to avoid triggering Google's rate limiting
5. **Combine With Other Tools**: Use these dorks alongside other reconnaissance tools for best results

12. **Source Code and Version Control**: Find sensitive information in source code repositories
13. **Mobile Application Related**: Discover vulnerabilities related to mobile applications

## üìä Success Metrics

While results vary significantly based on targets and timing, users of these dorks have reported:
- Discovery of previously unknown bug bounty programs
- Identification of critical vulnerabilities in high-value targets
- Location of exposed sensitive information and credentials
- Finding misconfigurations in cloud services and APIs

## üîÑ Usage Workflow

For optimal results, follow this workflow:

1. **Program Discovery**: Start with dorks in the "Bug Bounty Program Discovery" section
2. **Target Enumeration**: Once you've identified targets, use subdomain discovery dorks
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Apply technical vulnerability dorks to identify potential issues
4. **Deep Dive**: Use the elite and advanced dorks for specialized hunting
5. **Documentation**: Document all findings thoroughly
6. **Verification**: Verify vulnerabilities before reporting
7. **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow the program's disclosure guidelines when reporting

## üåê Advanced Tips

- **Chain Operators**: Combine multiple search operators for more precise results
- **Use Time Filters**: Focus on recently indexed content for fresh findings
- **Leverage Site Specificity**: Target specific file types or directories
- **Automate Wisely**: Consider automating searches with proper rate limiting
- **Monitor Program Changes**: Regularly check for new or updated bug bounty programs

## üìå Example Use Cases

### Finding High-Reward Programs
```
intitle:"bug bounty" AND intext:"$10,000" OR intext:"$20,000"
```
This dork helps identify programs offering substantial rewards for critical vulnerabilities.

### Discovering Exposed API Keys
```
site:github.com "target.com" password | api_key | apikey | secret | token
```
This query can uncover accidentally committed API keys and secrets in public repositories.

### Locating SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
```
site:target.com intext:"SQL syntax error"
```
This helps identify potential SQL injection points by finding error messages.
